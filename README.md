# Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using OpenCV  

## Introduction  

This project implements **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** using OpenCV and EasyOCR. It detects number plates in images or video frames and extracts text using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**.  

 ## Features  

- Detects vehicle number plates from images or videos  
- Uses **OpenCV** for image processing and contour detection  
- Utilizes **EasyOCR** for text extraction  
- Draws bounding boxes and overlays extracted text on the image
